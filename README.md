# Mine_Sweeper
We all know the popular 90's game Mine Sweeper. This is my attenmp to understand the basics of the game and replicate it. I hope you enjoy it !!!

# How to Win:

The game features a grid of clickable tiles, with hidden "mines" (depicted as naval mines in the original game) scattered throughout the board. The objective is to clear the board without detonating any mines, with help from clues about the number of neighboring mines in each field.
